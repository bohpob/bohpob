## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bohdan, a student studying software engineering. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Czech Technical University in Prague in the summer of 2024. 
Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in the same field at CTU, furthering my expertise in software development.
